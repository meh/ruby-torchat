Groupchat extension lifecycle and packet description
====================================================
The person that starts the groupchat starts it by inviting the first person
to it, the invite packet has a cookie inside that will also be the id of the
groupchat throughout all its lifecycle.

After the invite packet a participants packet is sent to the invited person,
this packet has inside the list of ids of the current groupchat.

After receiving the participants packet the invited starts connections to all the
participants and sends them a packet asking them if they're really participating
in the groupchat. The contacts that aren't in his buddy list are added as temporary
buddies. If any of the participants are in his blocked list, a leave packet will be
sent, refusing to join the groupchat, otherwise a join packet will be sent.

After the participants packet an invited packet is sent to the already present participants,
in this way they'll know who invited that person and that that person is going to join the
groupchat.

The messaging in the groupchat is simply sent to every other participant from the sender
of the message.

To exit the groupchat a leave packet is sent to every participant present in the groupchat.

On disconnection of any of the participants it will obviously mean leaving the groupchat.

Redundancy Extension Packets
----

### Groupchat Echo Message

This packet is used to implement redundancy (requires autodrop_user to be disabled, and a 'redundacy extention' to be implemented), it is sent to every participant and contains the id of the groupchat, and the message. It also has the 'claimed' address of the sender.

```
> groupchat_echoed_message 6f012391-883d-4f4f-8d54-52c4227b3ac9 jdurifleoskgiege Hi guise
```

WHERE groupID='6f012391-883d-4f4f-8d54-52c4227b3ac9', torchatOriginatorAddress='jdurifleoskgiege', msg='Hi guise'



Note: 
This is for the 'groupchat trust/redundancy' extention. It is not part of core definition, but will be supported by jtorchat by default.
I was thinking of including the address of the 'echoer' but thats just plain redundant (and can be spoofed)
The good thing about making it this way, is that the entire string can be 'hashed', and used to match/listen for any more attestion (echo packets) by other members.
